## Applications and Projects

 In a series of Application Challenges will see 
 
 - how genome assembly can be used to track the source of a food poisoning outbreak, 
 
 - how RNA-Sequencing can help us analyze gene expression data on the tissue level, and 
 
 - compare the pros and cons of whole genome vs. whole exome sequencing for finding potentially harmful mutations in a human sample.
